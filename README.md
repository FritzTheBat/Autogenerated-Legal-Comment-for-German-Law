* Which problems does your idea tackle?
In Germany, laws are often written in an ambiguous way and it is left to courts to define a more precise meaning. These comments to laws by judges are particularly important but difficult to find. We automatically detect these sentences and provide a ranked list of comments for a specific law paragraph.
